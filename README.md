This aplication is a password manager.
It is a engineer thesis made by Maciej Bekas graduating at Warsaw Univercity of Technology.

Password Manager uses SQLite and SQLCipher instaled on the Window 10 system in corresponding versions SQLite version 3.31.0, SQLCipher 4.4.0 community.
## Installation

2 Compiling SQLCipher on Windows isn't easy so you should probably follow the steps from this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHGeetZ0po).

I do not recomend using it. If you want real password manager check [keypass](https://keepass.info)
