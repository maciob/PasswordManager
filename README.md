# PasswordManager
This application is a password manager.
It is a engineer thesis made by Maciej Bekas graduating at Warsaw University of Technology. 
## Technologies used
Password Manager uses SQLite and SQLCipher instaled on the Windows 10 system in the corresponding versions SQLite version 3.31.0, SQLCipher 4.4.0 community.
## Installation
1. Compile [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/).
2. Compiling SQLCipher on Windows isn't easy so you should probably follow the steps from this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHGeetZ0po).
3. Open CMD and in destination directory type in 'git clone https://github.com/maciob/PasswordManager'.
4. Open Developer Command prompt for VS2019, go to the destination directory and type in 'msbuild'.

## Warning
This password manager wasn't tested by professionall and probably does not assure full safety to your passwords.
I do not recomend using it. If you want to use real password manager check out [keypass](https://keepass.info)
