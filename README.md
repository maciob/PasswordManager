# PasswordManager
This application is a password manager.
It is a engineer thesis made by Maciej Bekas graduating at Warsaw University of Technology.

Password Manager uses SQLite and SQLCipher instaled on the Windows 10 system in the corresponding versions SQLite version 3.31.0, SQLCipher 4.4.0 community.
## Installation
1. Compile [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/).
2. Compiling SQLCipher on Windows isn't easy so you should probably follow the steps from this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFHGeetZ0po).
3. Open CMD and in destination directory type 'git clone https://github.com/maciob/PasswordManager'.

This password manager wasn't tested by professionall and probably does not assure full safety to your passwords.
I do not recomend using it. If you want to use real password manager check out [keypass](https://keepass.info)
